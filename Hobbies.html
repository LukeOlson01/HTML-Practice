<ul>
	<li>I enjoy spending time outside biking and hiking on the many trails around Columbia.</li>
	<li>I love to travel, whether it be somewhere around the country or overseas. I always look forward to visiting a new place and spending time with family during our trips.</li>
	<li>I enjoy cooking and spend a lot of time doing it as I work at a food truck every week.</li>
	<li>Now that I am learning to code, I might start new projects outside of schoolwork so I can get better at it.</li>
</ul>
